			<h2>Health Food tips:</h2>

During isolation it can be hard to be motivated to eat healthy and carry out meal prep, it can be easy to fall into bad habits.
Follow these tips to remain healthy during this time:
<ol>
	<li><strong>Add Herbs</strong><br>
		Culinary herbs are leafy plants that add flavour and colour to all types of meals. They are also rich in health-protective phytoestrogens. (help prevent bone loss in aging)
		In many cases, herbs can replace the flavour of salt and oil. Herbs are lightly flavoured, so add them to your cooking in the last few minutes.</li>
	<li><strong>Cutting down salt</strong><br>
		Salt is a common flavour enhancer, but research suggests that a high salt diet could contribute to a range of health problems including high blood pressure. Don’t automatically add salt to your food , taste it first as this is a bad habit.
		</li>
	<li><strong>Low fat cooking</strong><br>
		If you need to use oil, try cooking sprays or apply a small amount of oil with a pastry brush.
		Cook in liquids (such as stock, wine, lemon juice, vinegar or water) instead of oil.</li>
	<li><strong>fats to a minimum</strong> <br>
		If you add fats when cooking, keep them to a minimum and use monounsaturated oils such as olive oil.
		This recipe is SimplyHealth approved and is quick to make with worthy results.
		Potato and Green Bean salad:
		A nice idea for your lunch and easy to prepare , ready in 45 minutes.
